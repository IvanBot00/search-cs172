Career Fairs Open Doors
Each year, the Career Center hosts a number of Career Fairs. These are one-day recruiting events for firms in search of candidates for full-time, part-time, and internship positions.
Workshops & Information Sessions
Every quarter the Career Center offers a variety of workshops, information sessions, and networking events for students geared to help students from beginning to build their resume to those who have begun to plan for life after college. Information sessions allow students to meet and talk to representatives of top companies. Throughout the years there are many formal and informal networking events from coffee chats to etiquette dinners.
Check the Career Center calendar for any upcoming events that may address your students’ needs.
Connect with Your Career Specialist
Each college has a designated Career Specialist to support students, faculty, and staff. We invite you to connect with your Career Specialist to discuss partnerships and programming that would best support your students!
